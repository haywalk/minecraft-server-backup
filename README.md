# Minecraft Server Backup Script

This is the script I use to back up the [Space Hippie](https://www.spacehippie.ca) Minecraft server. I use Cron to run it every night at 22:00 local time.

To adjust this for your server, simply change the variables at the top.

For this to work, Minecraft has to be running in session 0 of Tmux.
